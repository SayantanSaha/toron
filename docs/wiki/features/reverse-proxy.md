# Reverse Proxy and Gateway Routing

## Overview

Toron includes a native **Reverse Proxy** engine (`pkg/proxy`), allowing it to route incoming client traffic to upstream backend HTTP microservices with load balancing, header sanitization, and path rewriting.

## Features

- **Upstream Forwarding**: Forwards request methods, query parameters, HTTP headers, and streaming request bodies.
- **Forwarded Header Sanitization & Trusted Proxy Chaining**: Injects and sanitizes standard origin headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, `X-Real-IP`, and W3C `traceparent`) while preventing client IP spoofing ([`SEC-31`](file:///Users/sneha/Developer/toron-research/toron/SECURITY_AUDIT.md#L428-L436), [`REQ-092`](file:///Users/sneha/Developer/toron-research/toron/docs/requirements/REQ-092.md), [`ADR-087`](file:///Users/sneha/Developer/toron-research/toron/docs/architecture/ADR-087.md)).
- **Automatic 3xx Redirect Rewriting**: Intercepts upstream `Location` redirect headers (`301`, `302`, `303`, `307`, `308`) and automatically prepends the route prefix (`/login` $\rightarrow$ `/api/login`), preventing 404s on prefix-routed legacy applications.
- **Set-Cookie Path Rewriting**: Automatically rewrites upstream `Set-Cookie: Path=/` attributes to `Path=<prefix>` to keep cookies properly scoped to the gateway route.
- **Configurable Strip Prefix**: Supports stripping the route prefix before dispatching upstream, or preserving the full path for native prefix-aware backends.
- **Resilient Fallback**: Returns `502 Bad Gateway` if the upstream server is offline or times out.

## Forwarded Header Sanitization & Anti-Spoofing (`trusted_proxies`)

Toron prevents client-side IP spoofing by deriving network identity from the physical transport connection (`RemoteAddr`) across HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 QUIC:

1. **Untrusted Connections (Default)**:
   - Client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers are **stripped and discarded**.
   - Upstream headers are overwritten strictly with the verified physical client address (`peerIP`):
     ```http
     X-Forwarded-For: <peerIP>
     X-Real-IP: <peerIP>
     X-Forwarded-Proto: https
     ```
2. **Verified Trusted Proxies**:
   - If the client's physical socket IP matches a configured `trusted_proxies` CIDR block:
     - Existing `X-Forwarded-For` is preserved, and `peerIP` is appended (`<existingXFF>, <peerIP>`).
     - Existing `X-Real-IP` is preserved.
3. **Preserved Mobile Roaming Affinity (REQ-030)**:
   - Sticky session load balancing (`pkg/proxy/sticky.go`) operates independently from access control. For `ip_hash` balancing, client-level headers continue to be inspected so mobile devices maintain affinity across carrier IP handovers and CGNAT reassignments without regression.

## Configuration in `routes.yaml`

```yaml
routes:
  # 1. Header routing + Load balancing across ports 9001-9003
  - type: "upstream"
    prefix: "/api"
    headers:
      X-Version: "v2"
    algorithm: "round_robin"
    targets:
      - "http://localhost:9001"
      - "http://localhost:9002"
      - "http://localhost:9003"
    strip_prefix: true            # Strips /api before forwarding (default: true)
    rewrite_redirects: true       # Rewrites Location: /login -> /api/login (default: true)
    rewrite_cookie_path: true     # Rewrites Set-Cookie: Path=/ -> Path=/api (default: true)

  # 2. Secure upstream with trusted proxy chaining
  - type: "upstream"
    prefix: "/services/partner"
    target: "http://localhost:9005"
    trusted_proxies:
      - "198.51.100.0/24"         # Appends peerIP for requests from this CIDR; strips headers from all others

  # 3. Legacy backend with automatic redirect and cookie path rewriting
  - type: "upstream"
    prefix: "/services/auth"
    target: "http://localhost:9008"
    rewrite_redirects: true
    rewrite_cookie_path: true

  # 4. Native prefix-aware backend (preserving full path, disabling redirect rewrites)
  - type: "upstream"
    prefix: "/services/v2"
    target: "http://localhost:9009"
    strip_prefix: false
    rewrite_redirects: false
```

## Programmatic Route Registration

```go
r := router.New()

// Proxy all requests matching /api/v2/* to http://localhost:9090
if err := r.Proxy("/api/v2", "http://localhost:9090"); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Proxy error: %v", err)
}
```
